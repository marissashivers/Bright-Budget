        <p class="lead">
            PurchaseViz is an application I made to familiarize myself with web development, as well as build something that I wanted to use every day. This app draws inspiration from an app I use a lot - Mint. I wanted to build something similar to Mint in functionality, but simpler and entirely on my own.
        </p>

            The main goals I had for this project were to build something that I would actually use, something that was simple to look at, and something that I enjoyed using. I also wanted it to be highly customizable from a user's perspective. To achieve this, I allow users to enter in custom categories for their purchases, as well as set their own budgets for each category.

            I started experimenting with Vue.Js and Firebase with a tutorial I found on LinkedIn, and later expanded the app to use routing, Vuex, Firebase Authentication, and eventually Firebase Hosting. I also used Chart.js for visualizations and Bootstrap Vue for many of the components.
