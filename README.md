# WhereIsMyMoney
Personal project to get experienced with web development. Uses Vue.js, Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.

## About
This project focuses on money management, budgeting, and data visualization. It allows users to create an account, add purchases, customize purchase categories, visualize trends in their spending, and create and manage budgets.

I used Chart.js for the data visualization and Bootstrap for many of the buttons, forms, navigation, and other components.
